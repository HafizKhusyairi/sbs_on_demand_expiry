This is a script to scrape the list of expiring films from your favourites tab in SBS On Demand. You will need an SBS On Demand account, python, playwright, and bs4 installed. The script uses playwright to click each links in your favourites and beautifulsoup to parse the title and expiry. It will then output a csv table summarising this information.
